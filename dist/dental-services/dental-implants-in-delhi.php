								<h5 class="serv-title">Dental Implants</h5>
								<p>The implants act as a stable base for the artificial placement of the permanent or removable tooth. They actually work like an artificial root that is made to match your natural teeth. We use Titanium or Titanium alloys so that the implants fuse well with the jawbone. The dental implants work as efficiently as your lost tooth.</p>
								<h4 class="serv-title">Types of Dental implants</h4>
								<p class="serv-content">Matrix Dental & Skin Lounge basically gives you two types of implants options. In certain cases, conventional or immediate implants may be followed by immediate loading of crowns and bridges known as immediate loaded implants.</p>
								<h4 class="serv-title">1. Conventional Implants</h4>
								<p class="serv-content">Conventional implants are a permanent restoration solution that is applicable to almost anyone who is looking to replace one, multiple, or all missing teeth. These implants are normally done in 2 trips which are about 3 to 6 months apart. Conventional implants are usually done for most types of bone conditions, however if the patient is suffering major jaw bone loss, bone grafting is highly suggested prior to implantation.</p>
								<h4 class="serv-title">2. Immediate Implants</h4>
								<p class="serv-content">Immediate implant is the process of implanting teeth on the same day the teeth are extracted. Dentists recommend immediate implant only when the jaw bone conditions are good and the gum and surrounding area must be infection free. If the implant is sufficiently secure in the bone we can put a temporary crown on top and replace it with the permanent one once the implant has healed sufficiently.</p>
								<h4 class="serv-title">3. Immediate Loaded Implants</h4>
								<p class="serv-content">In normal scenario, we wait for approximately 3 months after the implant is inserted into the bone so that the implant gets unified with the bone perfectly. Then after that, we can put a crown on top of that implant and the process is known as implant loading. This is also called as 2 stage implant surgery; in which a surgery is done to drill implant in bone in the first stage and we load that implant with a crown after a gap of around 3 months in the second stage.</p>
								<p class="serv-content">However, in immediate loading implant process, we can load the implant immediately after placement on day 1. Specially designed implants are used in such cases and they differ from conventionally used implants which are usually done in 2 stages. The design of the implants used in immediate loading implant is such that it actively engages bone and allows a dentist to place the crown on day 1 itself.</p>

								</ul>
								<h4 class="serv-title">Single Tooth Missing</h4>
								<p class="serv-content">The single tooth implant restoration consists of the implant post, the abutment and the prosthetic crown itself. The abutment supports the crown and the crown is either cemented onto the abutment or held in place with a screw. Single tooth implant with a crown does not require cutting your adjacent healthy teeth for bridging and it is undoubtedly the best restoration treatment.</p>
								<h4 class="serv-title">Multiple Teeth Missing</h4>
								<p class="serv-content">Dental implants are stronger than the natural tooth roots; hence several missing teeth can sometimes be replaced with fewer implants if multiple teeth are missing within the same region. However, if several tooth are missing in different parts of the mouth, several single tooth implants are a good option.
