Root Canal Treatment is an advanced orthodontic treatment which is used to treat the worst dental issues and give relief to patients from severe pain caused due to various reasons. Within our tooth, under the “white enamel” and a hard layer called “dentin”, there is a very soft tissue known as “pulp”. This pulp chamber is filled with connective tissues, blood vessels as well as nerves supplements, which becomes the source of development for the root of the tooth. There can be many reasons for tooth ache like infection, grinding teeth, tooth trauma, or it can be due to a boil beneath gums of teeth.

								<h4 class="serv-title">Why do you need root canal treatment?</h4>
								<p class="serv-content">Root canal treatment is done when the pulp of the tooth gets inflamed or infected due to any injury, broken tooth or due to deep dental decay. If this pulp infection is not treated on time, it can lead to ulcer/boil causing severe and unbearable pain.

Unbearable tooth ache is the most common symptom indicating the need of root canal treatment, sometimes it may follow with severe head ache also.

								<h4 class="serv-title">How it is done?</h4>
								<p class="serv-content">Root canal treatment is considered as one of the most effective way to repair and save a highly infected tooth. This may require few visits to dentist as it is a multistep process. Before starting this treatment, your dentist will examine X-Ray reports to spot the exact location of decay. First and foremost step of root canal treatment is to give local anesthesia near the infected tooth and to make an opening near rear part of the infected tooth. The contaminated pulp is extracted through this opening followed by cleaning the root canal and pulp chamber to avoid any further infections. Next step after cleaning is filling, which is nothing but filling the roots that have been opened in order to remove the pulp with tiny cone-shaped pieces of gutta-percha (a firm rubber-like material) and sealed it off. Then lastly, crown is positioned around the tooth to give it a proper look and structure.
